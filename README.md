### Description

I have created a command-line application that tracks a company's employees, roles, and departments based on a user's input using the inquirer package.

### Process

- First I added my schema, seed and library files to store my classes.
- Then I worked on my employeeTracker.js file and started building my inquirer questions.
- Finally, I worked through all of the helper functions for each option that the user could choose.

### Installation

- I installed this application through node.js.

### Usage

- My application will be used to organize employee personnel information.
